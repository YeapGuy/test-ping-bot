# test-ping-bot
A primitively simply Discord bot just for testing. Replies to every "ping" message with "pong".

## How to use
Clone the repository,  put the token from your [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers) application at the very end of **index.js**, run `npm install` and you're ready to go! Now just run `node index.js` and the bot should be up and running. Send "ping" to any channel the bot can read and you'll receive "pong".
